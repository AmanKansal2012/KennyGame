# KennyGame
Project Implementation Details *
I have used the gridlayout of 4*4 where kenny's images  are placed. I have  called a handler class. I have made all the kennies invisible  and they will be visible at every 200 milli seconds. I have used an increase score function which increases the score on every tap of a random kenny, and also I have used the countdown timer which will start from 10 and will decrease till 0 and the message will pop up that time is over, we can also reestart or cam choose the new game .
I have used intents for the movement between activities.
It is a basic game which tests impulses ,stimuli and check our reflexes.
